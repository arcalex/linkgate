# Project LinkGate

We are developing a scalable tools environment for temporal graph visualization that's specially designed for web archive research.

The tools environment consists of the following:

* [link-serv](https://github.com/arcalex/link-serv)
* [link-indexer](https://github.com/arcalex/link-indexer)
* [link-viz](https://github.com/arcalex/link-viz)

While each of _link-serv_, _link-indexer_, and _link-viz_ has its own repo, this _linkgate_ repo is for common project material, including [research use cases for web archive graph visualization](https://github.com/arcalex/linkgate/wiki).

The project was started in January 2020 with funding by the [International Internet Preservation Consortium (IIPC)](https://netpreserve.org/) and is a collaborative effort between [Bibliotheca Alexandrina (BA)](https://bibalex.org/) and the [National Library of New Zealand (NLNZ)](https://natlib.govt.nz/).
